# 🌸 Flower Prediction - ML & Flask  

This is a **Flower Prediction** project built using **Machine Learning, Flask, and HTML**. The model predicts the type of flower based on input features, providing an interactive web interface for users to test predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Trained a Machine Learning model to classify flowers  
- Developed a web interface using Flask and HTML  
- User-friendly input form for flower attributes  
- Real-time prediction results displayed on the webpage  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (for ML model)  
- **Flask** (for web framework)  
- **HTML & CSS** (for frontend design)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (for training the model)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data processing)  

## 📜 Dataset  
The dataset used for training consists of flower features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. It is sourced from (mention dataset source).  

## 🔥 Future Enhancements  
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms  
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS)  
- Enhance UI with better styling and responsiveness
